## Welcome to the Open Security Community

We are a community dedicated to gathering users and builders of Open Source security software - and datasets - together.  We share a belief in open approaches to innovation.  And in the criticality of improving our effectiveness in cyber security.  

For the time being that primarily consists of our draft Manifesto: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18DjjhPG6kQfEd_IU3RkUDC6WFdqyurZ_VLfEI8KExhw/edit?usp=sharing

We will be bootstrapping this community, relying on each other, to bring more openness to the cyber security industry.

We want to provide a place that practioners - including especially security engineers - can learn about and help to build better solutions to pernicious problems. We are also extremely keen to enable the adoption of deep learning in ways that improve the productivity of security engineering and operations.

In practice that will mean:

builders of projects walking through their approach
new projects being hosted here
hackathons being run here to support any number of open security projects
Together we can - and must - improve the productivity of cyber security.
